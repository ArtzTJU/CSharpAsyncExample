# C# Async Example
Demostration of **async/await** keywords and **Task** class in C# (.NET Core 3.0) in Console Application  .

Based on [Microsoft - # Asynchronous programming with async and await](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/)  .

In our console application, we are going to demonstrate using async/await & Task class by using our class `Chef` to make a breakfast.


## Usage

 1. Navigate to folder with .csproj file
 2. `dotnet build` 
 3. `dotnet run` 
 4. Output can be observed in console

Every Chef class includes a delay multiplier property, which can be used to increase/decrease the delay in each chefs task.
